# Introduction

Wellcome to my portfolio! 

Who is me?!? R-> I'm Control and Automation Engineer end PhD in Electrical Engineering. Actualyment i work with backend devoloper in a startup (UUDI) - even with a more academic curriculum, I made the decision to reinvent myself professionally, after the world pandemic.

I hope so this portfolio can help any people interested in programming. I expect to contribute in your studies and improve myself more and more along the build this portfolio.

## Algoritmos e pseudoc√≥digos

- Flowgorithm 

Is a free beginner's programming language that is based on simple graphical flowcharts.

Typically, when a student first learns to program, they often use one of the text-based programming languages. Depending on the language, this can either be easy or frustratingly difficult. Many languages require you to write lines of confusing code just to display the text "Hello, world!".

By using flowcharts, you can concentrate on programming concepts rather than all the nuances of a typical programming language. You can also run your programs directly in Flowgorithm.

Once you understand programming logic, it is easy for you to learn one of the major languages. Flowgorithm can interactively convert your flowchart to over 18 languages. These include: C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, Python, Ruby, Swift, Visual Basic .NET, and VBA (used in Office).
